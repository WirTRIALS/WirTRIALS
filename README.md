We focus on Linked Data and research information. We provide a script to generate RDF Graph of professors and researchers of TU Chemnitz.

  

# Requirements

  

Python

  

## Configuration

  

  

## Setup via pip

  

To run this project locally, clone this repository. Go to the researchee directory and install the required dependencies using pip.

```
$ pip install package-name

$ python RDF.py
```

  

  

Have patience. The script will take a lot of time to generate RDF graph as we have more than 2000 professors and researchers along with their expertise data.

  

If you don't have the time, check database.xml to see the type of data, this script will generate.
